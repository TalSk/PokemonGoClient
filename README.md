# Pokéscanner
Pokémon scanner using Pokémon Go endpoints

## What is this?
Track Pokémon around your location.
This tool will let you:
- View the exact GPS location of a Pokémon who is 2 or 1 footprint away
- View the distance in meters in any Pokémon around you (Including those 3 footprints away!)

## Alright, I'm interested!
