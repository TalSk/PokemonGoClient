# PokémonGoClient
Pokémon Go client using Pokémon Go endpoints.

## What is this?
The code provides some Pokémon Go functionality; it serves as a client for the Pokémon Go servers.
This tool will let you:
- Scan for Pokémon around your location. (Plus exact location of Pokémon 2 or 1 paws away!)
- Retreive information about Pokéstops and gyms around your location
- Retreive information about your trainer

And in the future, using this tool, the following will be implemented:
- Auto-walker - for hatching eggs easily.
- Auto-PokéStopper
- Auto-PokéCatcher

## Alright, I'm interested!
Here's a tease of the scan feature:
